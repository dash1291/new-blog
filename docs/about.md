I'm Ashish. I'm part of the engineering team at [BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com). I love the internet and building stuff for it.

Get in touch with me if you have something to say. You can email me directly <mailto:ashish.dubey91@gmail.com>. I tweet occassionaly as [@dash1291](https://twitter.com/dash1291). I also have a [GitHub profile](https://github.com/dash1291), incase you want to checkout the mix of useful and useless hacks I've put together.
